# ShaderGraphCustomLighting
Implement lighting models from [Jordan Stevens's lighting models post] with shader graph using unlit graph.

The `CustomLighting.hlsl` include file is taking from one of Unity's official [shader demo]. 
With the include file we can get the porper shadow value to shade our surface.
